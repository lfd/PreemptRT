	  Enable the kernel to trace every kernel function. This is done
	  by using a compiler feature to insert a small, 5-byte No-Operation
	  instruction to the beginning of every kernel function, which NOP
	  sequence is then dynamically patched into a tracer call when
	  tracing is enabled by the administrator. If it's runtime disabled
	  (the bootup default), then the overhead of the instructions is very
	  small and not measurable even in micro-benchmarks.
