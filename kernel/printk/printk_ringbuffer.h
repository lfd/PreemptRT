/*
 * Descriptor Bootstrap
 *
 * The descriptor array is minimally initialized to allow immediate usage
 * by readers and writers. The requirements that the descriptor array
 * initialization must satisfy:
 *
 *   Req1
 *     The tail must point to an existing (committed or reusable) descriptor.
 *     This is required by the implementation of prb_first_seq().
 *
 *   Req2
 *     Readers must see that the ringbuffer is initially empty.
 *
 *   Req3
 *     The first record reserved by a writer is assigned sequence number 0.
 *
 * To satisfy Req1, the tail initially points to a descriptor that is
 * minimally initialized (having no data block, i.e. data-less with the
 * data block's lpos @begin and @next values set to FAILED_LPOS).
 *
 * To satisfy Req2, the initial tail descriptor is initialized to the
 * reusable state. Readers recognize reusable descriptors as existing
 * records, but skip over them.
 *
 * To satisfy Req3, the last descriptor in the array is used as the initial
 * head (and tail) descriptor. This allows the first record reserved by a
 * writer (head + 1) to be the first descriptor in the array. (Only the first
 * descriptor in the array could have a valid sequence number of 0.)
 *
 * The first time a descriptor is reserved, it is assigned a sequence number
 * with the value of the array index. A "first time reserved" descriptor can
 * be recognized because it has a sequence number of 0 but does not have an
 * index of 0. (Only the first descriptor in the array could have a valid
 * sequence number of 0.) After the first reservation, all future reservations
 * (recycling) simply involve incrementing the sequence number by the array
 * count.
 *
 *   Hack #1
 *     Only the first descriptor in the array is allowed to have the sequence
 *     number 0. In this case it is not possible to recognize if it is being
 *     reserved the first time (set to index value) or has been reserved
 *     previously (increment by the array count). This is handled by _always_
 *     incrementing the sequence number by the array count when reserving the
 *     first descriptor in the array. In order to satisfy Req3, the sequence
 *     number of the first descriptor in the array is initialized to minus
 *     the array count. Then, upon the first reservation, it is incremented
 *     to 0, thus satisfying Req3.
 *
 *   Hack #2
 *     prb_first_seq() can be called at any time by readers to retrieve the
 *     sequence number of the tail descriptor. However, due to Req2 and Req3,
 *     initially there are no records to report the sequence number of
 *     (sequence numbers are u64 and there is nothing less than 0). To handle
 *     this, the sequence number of the initial tail descriptor is initialized
 *     to 0. Technically this is incorrect, because there is no record with
 *     sequence number 0 (yet) and the tail descriptor is not the first
 *     descriptor in the array. But it allows prb_read_valid() to correctly
 *     report the existence of a record for _any_ given sequence number at all
 *     times. Bootstrapping is complete when the tail is pushed the first
 *     time, thus finally pointing to the first descriptor reserved by a
 *     writer, which has the assigned sequence number 0.

 *     The initial @head_id and @tail_id for the desc ring. It is at the last
