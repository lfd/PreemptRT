		Supporting multiple CPU idle levels in kernel

				cpuidle

General Information:

Various CPUs today support multiple idle levels that are differentiated
by varying exit latencies and power consumption during idle.
cpuidle is a generic in-kernel infrastructure that separates
idle policy (governor) from idle mechanism (driver) and provides a
standardized infrastructure to support independent development of
governors and drivers.

cpuidle resides under drivers/cpuidle.
