		Supporting multiple CPU idle levels in kernel

				cpuidle governors




cpuidle governor is policy routine that decides what idle state to enter at
any given time. cpuidle core uses different callbacks to governor while
handling idle entry.
* select_state() callback where governor can determine next idle state to enter
* prepare_idle() callback is called before entering an idle state
* scan() callback is called after a driver forces redetection of the states

More than one governor can be registered at the same time and
user can switch between drivers using /sysfs interface (when supported).

More than one governor part is supported for developers to easily experiment
with different governors. By default, most optimal governor based on your
kernel configuration and platform will be selected by cpuidle.

Interfaces:
int cpuidle_register_governor(struct cpuidle_governor *gov);
void cpuidle_unregister_governor(struct cpuidle_governor *gov);
