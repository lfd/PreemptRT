		Supporting multiple CPU idle levels in kernel

				cpuidle sysfs

System global cpuidle information are under
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle

The current interfaces in this directory has self-explanatory names:
* available_drivers
* available_governors
* current_driver
* current_governor

Per logical CPU specific cpuidle information are under
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/cpuidle
for each online cpu X

Under this percpu directory, there is a directory for each idle state supported
by the driver, which in turn has
* latency
* power
* time
* usage
