		Supporting multiple CPU idle levels in kernel

				cpuidle drivers




cpuidle driver supports capability detection for a particular system. The
init and exit routines will be called for each online CPU, with a percpu
cpuidle_driver object and driver should fill in cpuidle_states inside
cpuidle_driver depending on the CPU capability.

Driver can handle dynamic state changes (like battery<->AC), by calling
force_redetect interface.

It is possible to have more than one driver registered at the same time and
user can switch between drivers using /sysfs interface.

Interfaces:
int cpuidle_register_driver(struct cpuidle_driver *drv);
void cpuidle_unregister_driver(struct cpuidle_driver *drv);
int cpuidle_force_redetect(struct cpuidle_device *dev);
