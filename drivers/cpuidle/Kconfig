	help
	  CPU idle is a generic framework for supporting software-controlled
	  idle processor power management.  It includes modular cross-platform
	  governors that can be swapped during runtime.

	  If you're using a mobile platform that supports CPU idle PM (e.g.
	  an ACPI-capable notebook), you should say Y here.

	help
	  This cpuidle governor promotes and demotes through the supported idle
	  states using residency time and bus master activity as metrics.  This
	  algorithm was originally introduced in the old ACPI processor driver.
